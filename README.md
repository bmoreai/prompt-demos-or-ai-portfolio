# AI Prompt Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains examples of my work in **AI Prompt Engineering**, where I design, test, and refine structured prompts for real-world applications.  
It serves as both a learning portfolio and a showcase of my progress toward becoming a professional Prompt Engineer.

## 🔹 About the Project
The goal of this portfolio is to:
- Demonstrate structured **prompt design** across multiple use cases.  
- Show **AI system responses** with reasoning and risk analysis.  
- Provide recruiters, collaborators, and potential employers with insight into my approach.  

---

## 🔹 Current Demo Files

1. **First Prompt Demo**  
   *Simple starter file testing basic prompt/response structure.*  

2. **Conversation Coach — De-escalation**  
   *Generates supportive responses aimed at lowering tension in conversations.*  

3. **Conversation Coach — Boundary Setting**  
   *Prompts the AI to suggest respectful but firm replies when setting personal boundaries.*  

---

## 🔹 How to Use
Each demo file includes:
- A **conversation context** (sample dialogue).  
- A **prompt** given to the AI.  
- **Expected output format** with replies, reasoning, and risks.  

To replicate:
1. Copy the prompt from any demo file.  
2. Paste it into an AI model (e.g., GPT).  
3. Compare the results with the structured format provided.

## 🔹 Roadmap
- [ ] Add more **Conversation Coach demos** (light/friendly tone, scheduling, multilingual).  
- [ ] Publish demos for **business automation** (customer service, data analysis prompts).  
- [ ] Build a small **MVP “Conversation Coach” app** using these prompts.  

---

## 🔹 Next Steps
This repo will continue to grow weekly with new demos and applied projects.  
By documenting each step, I am building a transparent record of my **AI learning journey** while developing practical tools.
