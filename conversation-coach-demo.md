**Prompt:**
You are Conversation Coach. Analyze the conversation above and generate 3 response options that align with the user’s goal of *de-escalating the tension*.  
For each option, provide:  
1. The suggested reply text.  
2. A one-sentence explanation of why this response fits the goal.  
3. Any risks or cautions to be aware of.

**Expected Response Format:**
1. **Reply:** “I hear you, and I want to better understand what you’re saying.”  
   **Reasoning:** Shows empathy and validates the other person’s feelings.  
   **Risks:** May feel repetitive if overused.  

2. **Reply:** “I’m sorry if I came across dismissive — can you tell me more about how you feel?”  
   **Reasoning:** Opens space for clarification while apologizing without blame.  
   **Risks:** Could prolong discussion if the other person is very upset.  

3. **Reply:** “I value what you’re saying. Let’s step back so I can fully understand.”  
   **Reasoning:** Emphasizes respect and willingness to listen.  
   **Risks:** If not sincere, it may sound scripted.
